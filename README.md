## To do list

1. Compare molecules in S108 database and those of biomolecular fragments, including
  # 20 natural amino acids
  # unnatural amino acids
  # nucleic acids
  # sugar
  # lipid (header, tail)

1. Optimize the newly added monomers to their local minima
  # MP2/6-311G(d,p) 

1. Generate dimers with different interactions
  # consider different conformations for each dimer
  # optimize the dimer at MP2/cc-pvtz level

1. Energy decomposition using SAPT2+ at 7 distances
  # use the above optimized geometry
  # SAPT2+/aug-cc-pvtz

1. Derive the AMOEBA+ initial parameters using poltype
